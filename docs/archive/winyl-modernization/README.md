## Project Vision Summary

### Core Philosophy
Transform Winyl from a legacy music library manager into **"the oscilloscope for home audio"** - a modern, ephemeral analysis tool that preserves superior bit-perfect audio capabilities while adding professional-grade audio analysis features.

### Key Objectives
1. **Preserve Audio Excellence**: Maintain 100% of Winyl's BASS-powered audio capabilities
2. **Modernize Interface**: Replace legacy UI with modern WebView2-based interface  
3. **Add Analysis Tools**: Implement professional audio analysis for audiophiles and engineers
4. **Simplify Experience**: Transform from library manager to ephemeral analysis tool

### Target Users
- **Audiophiles**: Users with high-end audio equipment seeking bit-perfect playback
- **Audio Engineers**: Professionals needing real-time audio analysis tools
- **Music Enthusiasts**: Technical users interested in understanding audio quality

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Audio Engine Preservation (Months 1-3)
Extract and preserve core audio functionality without any quality degradation.

### Phase 2: Minimal Viable Product (Months 4-6) 
Create basic functional audio player with modern WebView2 UI.

### Phase 3: Core Analysis Features (Months 7-12)
Implement fundamental audio analysis: spectrum analysis, loudness metering, dynamic range.

### Phase 4: Advanced Analysis (Months 13-18)
Add professional features: distortion analysis, format validation, intelligent album mode.

### Phase 5: Polish & Community (Months 19-24)
Production readiness, performance optimization, and community engagement.

## Key Technologies

### Preserved Components
- **BASS Audio Library**: Commercial audio engine for bit-perfect playback
- **ASIO/WASAPI Support**: Professional audio driver interfaces
- **Audio Processing Chain**: Real-time effects and analysis

### New Components  
- **WebView2**: Modern web-based user interface
- **C++20**: Modern C++ for new components
- **HTML5/CSS3/JS**: Responsive web UI with real-time visualizations
- **FFTW3**: Fast Fourier Transform for spectrum analysis

## Critical Success Factors

### Non-Negotiable Requirements
1. **Audio Quality**: No degradation in bit-perfect playback capabilities
2. **Performance**: Real-time analysis without affecting audio processing
3. **Compatibility**: Support for all current audio formats and hardware
4. **Reliability**: Professional-grade stability for critical audio applications

### Quality Gates
- Comprehensive audio regression testing
- Bit-perfect validation with measurement tools
- Community testing with audiophile hardware
- Performance benchmarking at each milestone

## Getting Started with Development

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2022 with C++ development tools
