```

### 2. Governance Model
**Structure**: Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL) transitioning to Technical Steering Committee

#### Initial Phase (Months 1-12):
- **Project Lead**: Makes all major technical decisions
- **Core Team**: 2-3 trusted contributors with commit access
- **Community**: Contributors and testers

#### Mature Phase (Year 2+):
```
Technical Steering Committee (TSC)
├── Audio Engineering Lead    (Audio algorithms and quality)
├── Software Architecture Lead (C++ core and performance)
├── UI/UX Lead               (WebView2 and user experience)
└── Community Lead           (Documentation and outreach)

Advisory Board
├── Professional Audio Expert (Industry validation)
├── Audiophile Representative (Community voice)
└── Academic Partner         (Research collaboration)
```

## Technical Sustainability

### 1. Architecture for Longevity
**Principle**: Minimize dependencies, maximize modularity

#### Dependency Management Strategy:
```cpp
// Critical Dependencies (Monitor closely)
BASS Audio Library {
    Risk: Commercial library, potential licensing changes
    Mitigation: Maintain good relationship with Un4seen Developments
    Backup Plan: Evaluate open-source alternatives (PortAudio + libsndfile)
    Review Frequency: Annual
}

WebView2 {
    Risk: Microsoft technology, potential API changes
    Mitigation: Use stable APIs, avoid bleeding-edge features
    Backup Plan: Qt WebEngine or native UI fallback
    Review Frequency: Every Windows update
}

Windows APIs {
    Risk: Platform lock-in, API deprecation
    Mitigation: Use well-established APIs, avoid preview features
    Backup Plan: Cross-platform port consideration
    Review Frequency: Bi-annual
}
```

#### Modular Architecture Benefits:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     Modular Design                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────────────┐ │
│  │ Audio Core  │  │ Analysis    │  │ UI Layer            │ │
│  │ (Stable)    │  │ Engine      │  │ (Replaceable)       │ │
│  │             │  │ (Extensible)│  │                     │ │
│  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └─────────────────────┘ │
│         │                 │                 │               │
│  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────────────┐ │
│  │ BASS        │  │ DSP         │  │ WebView2            │ │
│  │ Library     │  │ Algorithms  │  │ / Alternative       │ │
│  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └─────────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. Code Quality and Documentation
**Principle**: Code should be self-documenting and maintainable by future contributors

#### Documentation Standards:
```cpp
// Audio Engine Documentation
/**
 * @brief Core audio engine providing bit-perfect playback
 * 
 * This class maintains the sacred audio path that must never be compromised.
 * Any changes to this class require:
 * 1. Bit-perfect validation testing
 * 2. Review by Audio Engineering Lead  
 * 3. Community testing with multiple audio interfaces
 * 
 * @warning Never modify real-time audio threads without extensive testing
 * @see docs/audio_architecture.md for detailed design rationale
 */
class AudioEngine {
    /**
     * @brief Load audio file for playback
     * @param filepath Path to audio file (must be UTF-16 on Windows)
     * @returns true if file loaded successfully, false otherwise
     * 
     * Supported formats: FLAC, WAV, MP3, OGG, AAC, APE, WMA, DSD
     * Thread-safe: Yes (can be called from any thread)
     * Real-time safe: No (blocks for file I/O)
     */
    bool LoadFile(const std::wstring& filepath);
};
```

#### Code Review Process:
```markdown
All code changes require:
1. Automated test passing (CI/CD)
2. Code review by relevant lead
3. Documentation updates if needed
4. Audio testing for audio-related changes

Critical Path Changes (Audio Engine):
1. Design document before implementation
2. Review by Audio Engineering Lead + one other TSC member  
3. Bit-perfect validation testing
4. Community beta testing
5. Final approval by TSC vote
```

### 3. Performance and Compatibility Monitoring
**Principle**: Maintain performance and compatibility across Windows versions and hardware

#### Automated Monitoring:
```yaml
# Continuous Performance Monitoring
Performance Benchmarks:
  Audio Latency:
    Target: < 15ms (ASIO), < 50ms (WASAPI)
    Frequency: Every build
    Alert: > 20ms (ASIO), > 75ms (WASAPI)
  
  Memory Usage:
    Target: < 100MB typical, < 500MB peak
    Frequency: Every build  
    Alert: > 150MB typical, > 750MB peak
  
  CPU Usage:
    Target: < 5% for analysis
    Frequency: Every build
    Alert: > 8% for analysis

Compatibility Matrix:
  Windows Versions: [Windows 10 1903+, Windows 11]
  Audio Interfaces: [Focusrite, RME, MOTU, Behringer, Realtek]
  Test Frequency: Monthly
  Community Testing: Before releases
