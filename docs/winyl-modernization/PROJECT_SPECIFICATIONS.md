- [ ] Maintain compatibility with existing audio drivers
- [ ] Support high-DPI displays (100%, 125%, 150%, 200%)
- [ ] Work with all major DAC/audio interface brands

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Reliability
- [ ] Audio playback must never glitch or drop samples
- [ ] Analysis measurements must be scientifically accurate
- [ ] Application should handle file errors gracefully
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended operation

### Usability
- [ ] Intuitive interface for technical users

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
1. All existing audio functionality preserved without degradation
2. New analysis features meet professional audio tool standards
3. Performance requirements met on target hardware
4. Zero audio dropouts or glitches during operation

### User Success
1. Positive feedback from audiophile community
2. Adoption by audio professionals for analysis tasks
3. Educational value demonstrated through user feedback
4. Successful differentiation from generic media players

### Project Success
1. Delivered within 24-month timeline
2. Maintainable codebase for future development
3. Clear migration path from legacy Winyl
4. Documentation sufficient for community contributions

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must use BASS audio library (licensing and performance)
- Windows-only due to BASS and ASIO dependencies
- WebView2 requirement limits to Windows 10+
- Real-time analysis limited by system performance

### Resource Constraints
- Limited development team (1-3 people)
- No dedicated QA resources
- Limited budget for professional audio testing equipment
- Community-based testing and feedback

### Timeline Constraints
- 18-24 month development window
- Incremental delivery preferred over big-bang release
- Must maintain compatibility during transition

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Audio Engine Modification**: Any changes to core audio could break bit-perfect playback
- **BASS Library Dependencies**: Reliance on third-party commercial library
- **Performance of Analysis**: Real-time analysis may impact audio performance

### Medium Risk
- **WebView2 Adoption**: Relatively new technology with potential compatibility issues
- **User Acceptance**: Significant UI change may alienate existing users
- **Complexity Management**: Adding analysis features while maintaining simplicity

### Low Risk
- **Development Tools**: Visual Studio and Windows development environment well understood
- **Documentation**: Existing codebase provides reference for audio implementation

## Next Steps
1. Detailed technical architecture design
2. Project roadmap with specific milestones
3. Proof of concept implementation
4. Community feedback collection
5. Resource planning and allocation
