# The Winyl Quest: Archaeological Audio Engineering

*"La exploraci√≥n sistem√°tica del legado audio de Winyl"*

## üèõÔ∏è THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL MISSION

This project is an archaeological exploration of Alex Kras's Winyl music player, using his code commentary and community feedback as a map to build the next generation of audio geek applications.

### üéØ The Quest

**Vision**: Build the audio geek application that covers the specific niche of bit-perfect playback in a simple reproducer rather than a DAW with its immense complexity layer.

**Method**: Use Alex Kras's project and his testimony as the engine to explore the BASS library in its most extensive and complete implementation of current functionality.

**Foundation**: Honor Alex's work while solving the historical issues his community has been requesting for years.

*Remember when music collections were crafted with devotion? When cue logs were shared like sacred texts, and every pristine copy was too precious to let slip into anonymous digital oblivion. We used to listen to complete albums, meticulously organised, metadata corrected down to every accent mark - obsessive, certainly, but in those days afternoons had room for everything: every record, all of it could fit into a single afternoon. Hard to believe now. A gift for solitary fanatics. Unfold those FLAC collections and find again the lost taste of detail in music.*

*Thanks to Alex Kras, the original author of this meticulous piece of art - a player with the rare distinction of delivering bit-perfect FLAC reproduction on native Windows, one of the few free applications to implement full WASAPI compatibility. A strange gem, one we loved for a very long time.*
