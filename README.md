# Winyl - Professional Audio Player

Remember when music collections were crafted with devotion? When cue logs were shared like sacred texts, and every pristine copy was too precious to let slip into anonymous digital oblivion. We used to listen to complete albums, meticulously organised, metadata corrected down to every accent mark - obsessive, certainly, but in those days afternoons had room for everything: every record, all of it could fit into a single afternoon. Hard to believe now. A gift for solitary fanatics. Unfold those FLAC collections and find again the lost taste of detail in music.

Thanks to the original author of this meticulous piece of art - a player with the rare distinction of delivering bit-perfect FLAC reproduction on native Windows, one of the few free applications to implement full WASAPI compatibility and bring it to end users. A strange gem, one we loved for a very long time.
