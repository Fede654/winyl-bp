# Winyl Player - Modernization Project

A modernized version of the Winyl audio player, preserving its exceptional audio quality while updating the build system for contemporary development environments.

## 🎯 Project Vision

Transform Winyl into "el reproductor que te deja saber lo que está saliendo por tu placa de audio" - a player that provides complete transparency about your audio output while maintaining the superior bit-perfect playback quality that made Winyl unique.

## 📊 Current Status

**Milestone 1: ✅ COMPLETED** - Build System Modernization
- ✅ Migrated from Visual Studio 2017 XP toolset to VS2019 v142
- ✅ Updated Windows SDK to 10.0 
- ✅ Resolved all dependency compilation issues
- ✅ Generated working Winyl.exe executable
- ✅ **Build Status: 0 errors, 0 warnings**

## 🔧 Technical Approach

### Dependencies Successfully Integrated
- **BASS Audio Library** - Professional audio engine for bit-perfect playback
- **SQLite3** - Built from source for database functionality  
- **TagLib** - Metadata handling with compatibility layer
- **pugixml** - XML configuration parsing

### Build Requirements
- Visual Studio 2019 Build Tools (v142 toolset)
- Windows SDK 10.0
- MSBuild 16.x or later

## 🏗️ Development Philosophy

**Incremental Modernization**: We prioritize getting a working build first, then systematically replace compatibility layers with full implementations. This approach ensures:
- ✅ Immediate buildable state for development
- ✅ Preserved core audio architecture  
- ✅ Minimal risk of breaking existing functionality
- ✅ Clear upgrade path for each component

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Fede654/winyl-bp.git
cd winyl-bp

# Build the project
msbuild Winyl\Winyl.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x64
```

The executable will be generated at: `Winyl\x64\Debug\Winyl.exe`

## 📋 Next Milestones

- **Milestone 2**: Full TagLib integration for complete metadata support
- **Milestone 3**: Enhanced audio pipeline analysis and monitoring
- **Milestone 4**: Modern UI improvements while preserving audio purity
